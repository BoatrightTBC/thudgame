This is an implementation of Thud!, a boardgame by Trevor Truran, first published in 2002, inspired by the Discworld novels. 

It aims to offer both backwards compatibility with the existing Thud! application while adding new features such as drag-n-drop interface, computer opponents (AI) and support for all available rulesets including Koom Valley Thud!.

This app runs on Python3 and has no additional dependencies.
